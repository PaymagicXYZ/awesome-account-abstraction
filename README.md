## Overview
Account Abstraction (AA) is the movement within Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains to improve transaction user experience by using smart contract wallets as primary accounts as opposed to externally-owned accounts (EOAs). [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) is the leading standard for implementing AA wallets, which has the benefit of not needing consensus-layer protocol changes, improves UX through bundled transactions, allows free/subsidized/token-paid gas costs, and supports optional privacy and signature enchancing features.
